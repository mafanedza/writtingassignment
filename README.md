# MY HISTORY
I am Mafandza Nephawe, I am currently 23 years old.
I come from a family of 6, I have 4 siblings and I am the eldest of the four.
I was born in a village called Khumbe which is in venda in the Limpopo province, this is also where I spent most of my childhood.
my education jorney started in a day care centre called calvery, thereafter i went to a primary shool called Makwarela.
When I turn 12 my family moved to johannesburg in search of greener pastures, that is where I started my high school.
So I went to a priary school called lethulwazi comprehensive shool, which is in vosloorus, it was in this high school that my love for public speaking and debate was ignited, I took part in a number of different copetitions against other schools.
I finshed my matric in 2015, and I finished top of my class in both mathematics and science.
