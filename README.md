# MY HISTORY

My name is Mafandza Nephawe, I am currently 23 years old.
I come from a family of 6, I have 4 siblings and I am the eldest of the four.
I was born in a village called Khumbe which is in venda in the Limpopo province, this is also where I spent most of my childhood.
my education journey started in a day care centre called calvery, thereafter I went to a primary school called Makwarela.
When I turn 12 my family moved to Johannesburg in search of greener pastures, that is where I started my high school.
I went to a secondary school called lethulwazi comprehensive shool, which is in vosloorus, it was in this high school that my love for public speaking and debate was ignited, I took part in a number of different competitions against other schools.
I finshed my matric in 2015, and I finished top of my class in both mathematics and science.
I then went to the university of the witwatersrand, where I did my BSc degree in mathematics, corporate finance and investment, after my BSc I did my  Honors degreee in mathematical science at the same institution. You probably can already tell that I love mathematics. My journey at wits
wasn't smooth, but I absolutelly enjoyed myself there, I learned a lot of things and I got an amazing network out of it.
